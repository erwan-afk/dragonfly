              This policy explains in detail how “DRAGONFLY Trimarans User
              Forum” along with its affiliated companies (hereinafter “we”,
              “us”, “our”, “DRAGONFLY Trimarans User Forum”,
              “https://www.dragonfly-trimarans.org/phpBB”) and phpBB
              (hereinafter “they”, “them”, “their”, “phpBB software”,
              “www.phpbb.com”, “phpBB Limited”, “phpBB Teams”) use any
              information collected during any session of usage by you
              (hereinafter “your information”).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Your information is collected via two ways. Firstly, by browsing
              “DRAGONFLY Trimarans User Forum” will cause the phpBB software to
              create a number of cookies, which are small text files that are
              downloaded on to your computer’s web browser temporary files. The
              first two cookies just contain a user identifier (hereinafter
              “user-id”) and an anonymous session identifier (hereinafter
              “session-id”), automatically assigned to you by the phpBB
              software. A third cookie will be created once you have browsed
              topics within “DRAGONFLY Trimarans User Forum” and is used to
              store which topics have been read, thereby improving your user
              experience.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We may also create cookies external to the phpBB software whilst
              browsing “DRAGONFLY Trimarans User Forum”, though these are
              outside the scope of this document which is intended to only cover
              the pages created by the phpBB software. The second way in which
              we collect your information is by what you submit to us. This can
              be, and is not limited to: posting as an anonymous user
              (hereinafter “anonymous posts”), registering on “DRAGONFLY
              Trimarans User Forum” (hereinafter “your account”) and posts
              submitted by you after registration and whilst logged in
              (hereinafter “your posts”).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Your account will at a bare minimum contain a uniquely
              identifiable name (hereinafter “your user name”), a personal
              password used for logging into your account (hereinafter “your
              password”) and a personal, valid email address (hereinafter “your
              email”). Your information for your account at “DRAGONFLY Trimarans
              User Forum” is protected by data-protection laws applicable in the
              country that hosts us. Any information beyond your user name, your
              password, and your email address required by “DRAGONFLY Trimarans
              User Forum” during the registration process is either mandatory or
              optional, at the discretion of “DRAGONFLY Trimarans User Forum”.
              In all cases, you have the option of what information in your
              account is publicly displayed. Furthermore, within your account,
              you have the option to opt-in or opt-out of automatically
              generated emails from the phpBB software.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Your password is ciphered (a one-way hash) so that it is secure.
              However, it is recommended that you do not reuse the same password
              across a number of different websites. Your password is the means
              of accessing your account at “DRAGONFLY Trimarans User Forum”, so
              please guard it carefully and under no circumstance will anyone
              affiliated with “DRAGONFLY Trimarans User Forum”, phpBB or another
              3rd party, legitimately ask you for your password. Should you
              forget your password for your account, you can use the “I forgot
              my password” feature provided by the phpBB software. This process
              will ask you to submit your user name and your email, then the
              phpBB software will generate a new password to reclaim your
              account.
